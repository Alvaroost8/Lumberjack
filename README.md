# Lumberjack

## Synthesis Project - Group 8

Lumberjack is our answer to the cybersecurity challenge posed by malicious logs. Just like a skilled lumberjack cuts through trees, we cut through the noise of suspicious logs using AI. Our mission is to score logs based on their potential maliciousness, and handing those scores upon a threshold to a cybersecurity specialist.

### Scope

**Potential Features:**
- **Real-Time Log Score Computation:** Continuously assess log data in real-time.
- **CSV Extraction:** Extract suspicious logs along with reasons for further analysis.
- **Single Log Analyzer:** Input a specific log for scoring and detailed analysis.
- **Periodic Retraining:** Retrain the AI model periodically or after processing a certain volume of logs.
- **Suspicion Indication:** Identify logs with abnormal activity for further human analysis.

### Quality

Lumberjack is a web application crafted with cybersecurity excellence in mind. Developed primarily using Python with the Django framework, it ensures robustness and scalability. Django, trusted by industry giants like Instagram and Spotify, empowers us to deliver a high-quality, real-time cybersecurity solution.

Our commitment to privacy means that logs are securely processed and accessible only to authorized personnel. Lumberjack's machine learning algorithm surpasses human capabilities, offering unparalleled accuracy in identifying suspicious logs.

### Resources

As a team of aspiring AI professionals, we advocate for the use of open-source frameworks to build Lumberjack. Both Django and our custom AI models will be openly available, we want to create trust and transparency with our users. Our development process will be meticulously documented, resembling the collaborative nature of version control systems like Github (as you can see).

### Risks

**Potential Risks:**
- **Scalability Challenges:** Handling a vast influx of logs.
- **Data Insufficiency:** Adequate data required for effective model training.
- **Security Concerns:** Ensuring Lumberjack's security to protect client privacy.

### Other Constraints

We embrace the ethos of open-source development, advocating for transparency and community collaboration. All software used or created in the Lumberjack project will be open-source, reflecting our commitment to ethical and accessible technology solutions, also respecting and protecting the privacy of our users overall, not looking to sell anyones info, just want to make the internet a bit safer.
